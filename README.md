# Advent of Code
_In which I try not to publicly embarrass myself_.

**This will serve as my source of public shaming.**

Structure is Year > Language > Day. I will first attempt all these in Go and then will attempt in
other languages as I work to learn them better. Sometimes I will intentionally use concepts that I
typically do not use in day-to-day just to get a feel for it (I'm looking at you Go + Closures).

## 2021 Cycle
- Completed: half of day 1.
- Incomplete: everything else.
